Kafka Streams is a Java streaming framework, that tightly integrates with Apacha Kafka. In contrast to Apache Spark of Apache Flink it does not require a separate cluster runtime. Instead it consist of a Java library to be fully integrated into any Java application. In that way it can augment the capabilities of that application by adding stream processing of Kafka topics. For a full feature  description of Kafka Streams check out the documentation on the Apache project page or from Confluent.
